entity.time-horizon

      time horizon object

    class                                         > TimeHorizon

      the TimeHorizon entity is REQUIRED and the
      'time-horizon' identifier is MANDATORY

    builtin-remark s                              <

    leap-year [-] b                               > 0

      the interval [300,86400] is further restricted to
      common multiples of one hour ranging 5 mins to 24 hours

      the start-hour begins midnight local time and ranges
      [0,23] and the start-day begins 01-Jan and ranges
      [1,365] -- used to align internal and model timeseries
      when the latter commences after 00:00 on 01 January

      when leap-year is true then 29 February is presumed to
      exist (although not all entities will support this)

    hemisphere s                                  > "S"

      the hemisphere is {N,S} for north and south

      the modeler should ensuring that timeseries data given
      elsewhere aligns with the specification given here

entity.overseer

      system coordination object

      originating domains: a, c, d, e, f

    class                                         > Overseer

      the Overseer entity is REQUIRED and the "overseer"
      identifier is MANDATORY

      the overseer does little more that invoke the various
      originating domains in nominated order at each new
      interval

      captrans-algorithm takes "fixed" | "simple" | "hop-relit"
      but only "simple" is currently implemented (this call
      contains experimental macro-controlled hop-relit code)

    ranked-orig-domains L (far-from-demand)       > "domain-controller-d domain-controller-a domain-controller-e domain-controller-f"

      the originating domain controllers must be given in
      order of DESCENDING priority, any unannounced domains
      will be discovered naturally during the various
      traversals

      nodal pricing domain

    class                                         > DomainController

      a domain controller entity (the only one provided)
      which can take one of a number of commitment modes --
      but REQUIRES that the managed entities support the
      elected mode

      these four GLPK solver behavior settings should
      normally be set to true unless run-time tests indicate
      otherwise -- also coeffs means structural coefficients

    ranked-selgates L                             > "gate-stated-tariff-elec-a01 gate-stated-tariff-elec-a02"

      the ranked-selgates (bridging the right side) must be
      null, one, or listed in DESCENDING priority

      the demand-junctions, which split and join demand, may
      be null, individual, or listed in no particular order

      the technical-assets should be limited to transmission
      assets and node caps, iff AC transmission is being

    class                                         > TeasCcgtCapture

      industrial-scale CCGT installation with carbon capture,
      featuring low-duty cutout and the influence of ambient
      air temperature on efficiency and capacity

      this asset builds on the CCGT class by downgrading the
      efficiency and capacity using fixed multipliers

      the modeler is responsible for ensuring that the
      parametrizations used here match the fuel type and
      whether the fuel is characterized by LHV or HHV

      the HHV of natural gas is about 54.0e+06 J/kg and
      combustion produces 2.74x carbon dioxide by mass

      my socket label is 'elec-1'

      two bids are made: a zero-price bid with the quantity

      industrial-scale carbon dioxide geological store using
      injection pumps powered by electricity

      in modeling terms, the facility "produces"
      supercritical carbon dioxide sequestration services on
      demand -- with the carbon dioxide flowing (somewhat
      paradoxically) parallel to demand

      the long-haul commitment to monitor leakage and
      maintain capping is not expressly represented

      the divisor is used to downsize a large capture
      facility for use in a reduced-scope model (in the same
      way that a building entity can be replicated by
      specifying a count of two or more)

      the demand-hi-bound defines the maximum sequestration
      rate and the specific-electricity-usage defines the
      electricity demand per unit sequestration

      the carbon-dioxide-leakage-rate per thousand years (1%

      contribution, assuming straight-line losses

      flow model and thereby ignore shunt losses -- this
      commodity provides suitable support

      square) voltage (as opposed to the peak-to-peak value)

      kg-quantified pressure state-changeable carbon dioxide
      sequestration-service commodity

      demand flow is antiparallel to physical flow, similar
      in behavior to that of a conventional fuel (like coal)

    builtin-remark s                              <

    pressures [Pa] F                              < 0.0 ..

      the carriage pressure is normally supercritical, around
      10.0e+03 kPa

    class                                         > CmElectricity

      J-quantified electricity commodity

      technical assets using electricity adopt a DC-power
      flow model and thereby ignore shunt losses -- this
      commodity provides suitable support

    builtin-remark s                              <

    voltage [V] f                                 > 11.0e+03

      for fixed-frequency AC power, use the RMS (root-mean-
      square) voltage (as opposed to the peak-to-peak value)
