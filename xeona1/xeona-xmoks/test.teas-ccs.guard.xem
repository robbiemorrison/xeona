entity.time-horizon

    class                                         > TimeHorizon

      the TimeHorizon entity is REQUIRED and the
      "time-horizon" identifier is MANDATORY

    builtin-remark s                              <

    steps [-] i                                   > 6

    leap-year [-] b                               > 0

      the interval [300,86400] is further restricted to
      common multiples of one hour ranging 5 mins to 24 hours

      the start-hour begins midnight local time and ranges
      [0,23] and the start-day begins 01-Jan and ranges
      [1,365] -- used to align internal and model timeseries
      when the latter commences after 00:00 on 01 January

      when leap-year is true then 29 February is presumed to
      exist (although not all entities will support this)

    hemisphere s                                  > "N"

      the hemisphere is {N,S} for north and south

      the modeler should ensuring that timeseries data given
      elsewhere aligns with the specification given here

entity.overseer

    class                                         > Overseer

      the Overseer entity is REQUIRED and the "overseer"
      identifier is MANDATORY

      the overseer does little more that invoke the various
      originating domains in nominated order at each new
      interval

    builtin-remark s                              <

    captrans-algorithm s                          > "simple"

      captrans-algorithm takes "fixed" | "simple" | "hop-relit"
      but only "simple" is currently implemented (this call
      contains experimental macro-controlled hop-relit code)

    ranked-orig-domains L                         > "domain-controller-1"

      the originating domain controllers must be given in
      order of DESCENDING priority, any unannounced domains
      will be discovered naturally during the various
      traversals

entity.domain-controller-1

    class                                         > DomainController

      a domain controller entity (the only one provided)
      which can take one of a number of commitment modes --
      but REQUIRES that the managed entities support the
      elected mode

    builtin-remark s                              <

    domain-role s                                 > "role"

      these four GLPK solver behavior settings should
      normally be set to true unless run-time tests indicate
      otherwise -- also coeffs means structural coefficients

    commitment-mode s                             > "fin"

    ranked-selgates L                             > ""

      the ranked-selgates (bridging the right side) must be
      null, one, or listed in DESCENDING priority

    asset-operators L                             > ""

      the asset-operators may be null, individual, or listed
      in no particular order

entity.teas-ccgt-capture-1

    class                                         > TeasCcgtCapture

      industrial-scale CCGT installation with carbon capture,
      featuring low-duty cutout and the influence of ambient
      air temperature on efficiency and capacity

      the modeler is responsible for ensuring that the
      parametrizations used here match the fuel type and
      whether the fuel is characterized by LHV or HHV

      my socket label is 'elec-1'

    builtin-remark s                              <

    socket-oxidize l                              > "teas-supplier-0.oxid-1"

    cable-carbon-seq-commodity l                  > "cm-carbon-seq-0"

      the socket-oxidize and cable-oxidize-commodity define
      my supplier and their socket label and our common
      oxidizable fuel commodity, similarly for
      socket-carbon-seq and cable-carbon-seq-commodity

    socket-electricity-commodity l                > "cm-electricity-0"

      the socket-electricity-commodity defines the common
      electricity commodity

    on-design-capacity [W] f                      > 360e+06
    on-design-efficiency [-] f                    > 0.55

    fuel-ancillary [W] f                          > 36e+03

      the on-design-capacity and on-design-efficiency
      are at 15C and 100kPa and based on net production,
      the cutout-capacity-factor is relative to the
      adjusted capacity, the cutout-efficiency-factor
      is relative to the adjusted efficiency, and the
      fuel-ancillary defines the shutdown fuel usage

   carbon-capture-rate [-] f                      > 0.90
   efficiency-hit [-] f                           > 0.10
   capacity-hit [-] f                             > 0.40

      the carbon-capture-rate [0,1] is self-explanatory and
      the efficiency-hit [0,1] is the increase in fuel load
      which results from the carbon capture subsystem (of
      unspecified technology) -- while plant cost increases
      should be factored in directly (see below)

    ambient-air-context l                         > "cx-ambient-air-tmy-1"

      the ambient-air-context provides temperature data,
      no adjustment is made for pressure or humidity

    shutdown-statuss [-] B                        < 0 ..

      productions represent the actual output figures,
      carbon-captures represent the carbon dioxide sent for
      sequestration, capacitys are the temperature-adjusted
      potentials, and shutdown-statuss are true (1) if the
      plant ran

    current-age [y] i                             > 2

      a negative capex-terminal indicates salvage revenue as
      opposed to decommissioning cost

    embedded-costs-financial [$] F                < 0.0 ..

      the embedded-costs-financial are calculated using the
      DCF annuity method over the economic life of the entity
      in question

entity.teas-ccs-geological-1

    class                                         > TeasCcsGeological

      industrial-scale carbon dioxide geological store using
      injection pumps powered by electricity

      in modeling terms, the facility "produces"
      supercritical carbon dioxide sequestration services on
      demand -- with the carbon dioxide flowing (somewhat
      paradoxically) parallel to demand

      the long-haul commitment to monitor leakage and
      maintain capping is not expressly represented

      my socket label is 'cseq-1'

    builtin-remark s                              <

    cable-electricity-commodity l                 > "cm-electricity-0"

      the socket-electricity and cable-electricity-commodity
      define my electricity supplier and their socket label
      and our common electricity commodity

    socket-carbon-seq-commodity l                 > "cm-carbon-seq-0"

      the socket-electricity-commodity defines the common
      electricity commodity

    specific-electricity-usage [J/kg] f           > 2.5e+05

      the demand-hi-bound defines the maximum sequestration
      rate and the specific-electricity-usage defines the
      electricity demand per unit sequestration

   carbon-dioxide-leakage-rate [1/1000yr] f       > 0.01

      the carbon-dioxide-leakage-rate per thousand years (1%
      is low) is used to calculate the sequestation
      contribution, assuming straight-line losses

      productions represent the actual sequestration
      services, electricity-demands are self-explanatory, and

    current-age [y] i                             > 2

      a negative capex-terminal indicates salvage revenue as

    embedded-costs-financial [$] F                < 0.0 ..

      ambient air context which serves the NIWA TMY (typical

      as currently code, the interval length must be 3600s
