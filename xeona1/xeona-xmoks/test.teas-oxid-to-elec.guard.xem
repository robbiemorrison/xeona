entity.time-horizon

    class                                         > TimeHorizon

      the TimeHorizon entity is REQUIRED and the
      "time-horizon" identifier is MANDATORY

    builtin-remark s                              <

    steps [-] i                                   > 6
    interval [s] i                                > 3600

    leap-year [-] b                               > 0

      the start-hour begins midnight local time and ranges
      [0,23] and the start-day begins 01-Jan and ranges [1,365]

      when leap-year is true then 29 February is presumed to
      exist (although not all entities will support this)

    hemisphere s                                  > "N"

      the hemisphere is {N,S} for north and south

      the modeler should ensuring that timeseries data given
      elsewhere aligns with the specification given here

      header: b/builtins.h

entity.overseer

    class                                         > Overseer

      the Overseer entity is REQUIRED and the "overseer"
      identifier is MANDATORY

      the overseer does little more that invoke the various
      originating domains in nominated order at each new
      interval

    builtin-remark s                              <

    captrans-algorithm s                          > "simple"

      captrans-algorithm takes "fixed" | "simple" | "hop-relit"
      but only "simple" is currently implemented (this call
      contains experimental macro-controlled hop-relit code)

    ranked-orig-domains L                         > "domain-controller-1"

      the originating domain controllers must be given in
      order of DESCENDING priority, any unannounced domains
      will be discovered naturally during the various
      traversals

    total-shortrun-landuse [m2] f                 < 0.0

      the cost-type totals cover the entire horizon, with
      first step truncation given by program.last-run.run-kind

entity.domain-controller-1

    class                                         > DomainController

      a domain controller entity (the only one provided)
      which can take one of a number of commitment modes --
      but REQUIRES that the managed entities support the
      elected mode

    builtin-remark s                              <

    domain-role s                                 > "role"

    init-use-simplex-presolver b                  > 1
    init-use-mip-presolver b                      > 1
    init-apply-numerical-zero b                   > 1

    trip-kkt-report-level i                       > 1
    trip-coeff-span-level i                       > 1

      these four GLPK solver behavior settings should
      normally be set to true unless run-time tests indicate
      otherwise -- also coeffs means structural coefficients

    commitment-mode s                             > "fin"

      supported commitment-mode values (lmp is nodal pricing):
      fin | ghg | nox | dep | luc | lmp | merit | first

    ranked-selgates L                             > ""

      the ranked-selgates (bridging the right side) must be
      null, one, or listed in DESCENDING priority

    asset-operators L                             > ""

      the asset-operators may be null, individual, or listed
      in no particular order

    demand-junctions L                            > ""

      the demand-junctions, which split and join demand, may
      be null, individual, or listed in no particular order

    variable-costs-financial [$] F                < 0.0 ..
    fixed-costs-financial [$] F                   < 0.0 ..

      the following are consolidations for the entire domain

    subtotal-financial [$] f                      < 0.0
    subtotal-greenhouse [kg] f                    < 0.0
    subtotal-nox [kg] f                           < 0.0

entity.teas-oxid-to-elec-1

    class                                         > TeasOxidToElec

      a simple fuel to power (thermal, fuel cell, or
      otherwise) power plant, with support for shutdown mode
      operation -- ancillary electricity demand is not
      included

    builtin-remark s                              <

    socket-oxidize l                              > "teas-supplier-0.oxid-1"
    cable-oxidize-commodity l                     > "cm-gas-0"

      the socket-oxidize and cable-oxidize-commodity define
      my supplier and their socket label and our common
      oxidizable fuel commodity

    socket-electricity-commodity l                > "cm-elec-0"

      the socket-electricity-commodity defines the common
      electricity commodity

    prod-lo-bound [W] f                           > 60.0
    prod-hi-bound [W] f                           > 90.0
    marginal-efficiency [-] f                     > 0.5
    fuel-noload [W] f                             > 10.0
    fuel-ancillary [W] f                          > 5.0

      the prod-hi-bound and prod-lo-bound set the production
      capacity and the shutdown mode threshold respectively,
      the marginal-efficiency and fuel-noload determine the
      operating curve, and the fuel-ancillary sets the
      shutdown fuel usage

    ramp-restraint-down [-] f                     > 2.0
    ramp-restraint-up [-] f                       > 2.0

      ramp-restraint-down and ramp-restraint-up restrict
      output steps relative to nameplate-capacity -- use
      values of prod-hi-bound/nameplate-capacity or more to
      prevent binding

    productions [W] F                             < 0.0 ..
    shutdown-statuss [-] B                        < 0 ..

      productions represent the actual output figures,
      shutdown-statuss are true (1) for non-shutdown

    nameplate-capacity [W] f                      > 80.0
    duty-specific-cost-financial [$/J] f          > 100.0

    standing-cost-financial [$/s] f               > 300.0

    variable-costs-financial [$] F                < 0.0 ..
    fixed-costs-financial [$] F                   < 0.0 ..

    annual-discount-rate-decimal [-] f            > 0.10

    capex-terminal [$] f                          > -10e+03
    current-age [y] i                             > 2

      a negative capex-terminal indicates salvage revenue as
      opposed to decommissioning cost

    embedded-costs-financial [$] F                < 0.0 ..

      the embedded-costs-financial are calculated using the
      DCF annuity method over the economic life of the entity
      in question
