entity.time-horizon

    class                                         > TimeHorizon

      the TimeHorizon entity is REQUIRED and the
      "time-horizon" identifier is MANDATORY

    builtin-remark s                              <

    steps [-] i                                   > 6

    leap-year [-] b                               > 0

      the start-hour begins midnight local time and ranges
      [0,23] and the start-day begins 01-Jan and ranges [1,365]

      when leap-year is true then 29 February is presumed to
      exist (although not all entities will support this)

    hemisphere s                                  > "N"

      the hemisphere is {N,S} for north and south

      the modeler should ensuring that timeseries data given
      elsewhere aligns with the specification given here

      header: b/builtins.h

entity.overseer

    class                                         > Overseer

      the Overseer entity is REQUIRED and the "overseer"
      identifier is MANDATORY

      the overseer does little more that invoke the various
      originating domains in nominated order at each new
      interval

    builtin-remark s                              <

    captrans-algorithm s                          > "simple"

      captrans-algorithm takes "fixed" | "simple" | "hop-relit"
      but only "simple" is currently implemented (this call
      contains experimental macro-controlled hop-relit code)

    ranked-orig-domains L                         > "domain-controller-1"

      the originating domain controllers must be given in
      order of DESCENDING priority, any unannounced domains
      will be discovered naturally during the various
      traversals

    total-shortrun-landuse [m2] f                 < 0.0

      the cost-type totals cover the entire horizon, with
      first step truncation given by program.last-run.run-kind

entity.domain-controller-1

    class                                         > DomainController

      a domain controller entity (the only one provided)
      which can take one of a number of commitment modes --
      but REQUIRES that the managed entities support the
      elected mode

    builtin-remark s                              <

    domain-role s                                 > "role"

    trip-coeff-span-level i                       > 1

      these four GLPK solver behavior settings should
      normally be set to true unless run-time tests indicate
      otherwise -- also coeffs means structural coefficients

    commitment-mode s                             > "fin"

      supported commitment-mode values (lmp is nodal pricing):
      fin | ghg | nox | dep | luc | lmp | merit | first

    ranked-selgates L                             > ""

      the ranked-selgates (bridging the right side) must be
      null, one, or listed in DESCENDING priority

    asset-operators L                             > ""

      the asset-operators may be null, individual, or listed
      in no particular order

    demand-junctions L                            > ""

      the demand-junctions, which split and join demand, may
      be null, individual, or listed in no particular order

    fixed-costs-financial [$] F                   < 0.0 ..

entity.teas-hydro-scheme-1

    class                                         > TeasHydroScheme

      a hydroelectric scheme with storage that receives
      inflows and which can spill water -- note that the
      opening and closing inventories are not required to
      match

      this entity is designed to be paired with
      AsopLmpBidHydro1 when part of a nodal market

      a scheme may represent more than one station if
      integrated and managed collectively

    builtin-remark s                              <

    socket-electricity-commodity l                > "cm-electricity-0"

      socket-electricity-commodity defines the shared
      electricity commodity

    inflow-context l                              > "cx-inflow-sets-1"

      the context entity must be a sub-class of CxInflow

    opening-storage [-] f                         > 0.9

      the reservoir-volume can be set to zero to yield
      run-of-river operation

    spill-count [-] i                             < 0

      inventory-delta [0,1] is the relative change,
      capacity-factor [0,1] is the ratio of potential output
      to generator-capacity, spill-factor is the ratio of
      discarded to potential output

    submitted-bidsets [W,$/J] X                   < "0.0 0.0" ..

      submitted-bidsets are provided by the operator, but

    current-age [y] i                             > 2

      a negative capex-terminal indicates salvage revenues as
      opposed to decommissioning cost
