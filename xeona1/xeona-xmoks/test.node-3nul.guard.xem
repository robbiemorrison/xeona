entity.time-horizon

    class                                         > TimeHorizon

      the TimeHorizon entity is REQUIRED and the
      "time-horizon" identifier is MANDATORY

    builtin-remark s                              <

    steps [-] i                                   > 6

    leap-year [-] b                               > 0

      the start-hour begins midnight local time and ranges
      [0,23] and the start-day begins 01-Jan and ranges [1,365]

      when leap-year is true then 29 February is presumed to
      exist (although not all entities will support this)

    hemisphere s                                  > "N"

      the hemisphere is {N,S} for north and south

      the modeler should ensuring that timeseries data given
      elsewhere aligns with the specification given here

      header: b/builtins.h

entity.overseer

    class                                         > Overseer

      the Overseer entity is REQUIRED and the "overseer"
      identifier is MANDATORY

      the overseer does little more that invoke the various
      originating domains in nominated order at each new
      interval

    builtin-remark s                              <

    captrans-algorithm s                          > "simple"

      captrans-algorithm takes "fixed" | "simple" | "hop-relit"
      but only "simple" is currently implemented (this call
      contains experimental macro-controlled hop-relit code)

    ranked-orig-domains L                         > "domain-controller-1"

      the originating domain controllers must be given in
      order of DESCENDING priority, any unannounced domains
      will be discovered naturally during the various
      traversals

    total-shortrun-landuse [m2] f                 < 0.0

      the cost-type totals cover the entire horizon, with
      first step truncation given by program.last-run.run-kind

entity.domain-controller-1

    class                                         > DomainController

      a domain controller entity (the only one provided)
      which can take one of a number of commitment modes --
      but REQUIRES that the managed entities support the
      elected mode

    builtin-remark s                              <

    domain-role s                                 > "role"

    trip-coeff-span-level i                       > 1

      these four GLPK solver behavior settings should
      normally be set to true unless run-time tests indicate
      otherwise -- also coeffs means structural coefficients

    commitment-mode s                             > "fin"

      supported commitment-mode values (lmp is nodal pricing):
      fin | ghg | nox | dep | luc | lmp | merit | first

    ranked-selgates L                             > ""

      the ranked-selgates (bridging the right side) must be
      null, one, or listed in DESCENDING priority

    asset-operators L                             > "asop-grid-1"

      the asset-operators may be null, individual, or listed
      in no particular order

    demand-junctions L                            > ""

      the demand-junctions, which split and join demand, may
      be null, individual, or listed in no particular order

    variable-costs-financial [$] F                < 0.0 ..
    fixed-costs-financial [$] F                   < 0.0 ..

      the following are consolidations for the entire domain

    subtotal-financial [$] f                      < 0.0
    subtotal-greenhouse [kg] f                    < 0.0
    subtotal-nox [kg] f                           < 0.0
    subtotal-depletion [J] f                      < 0.0

entity.asop-grid-1

    class                                         > AsopGrid

      asset operator which controls LMP nodes and
      transmission assets

    builtin-remark s                              <

    voltage-angle-reference [degree] f            > 0.0

      the technical-assets should be limited to transmission
      assets and node caps, iff AC transmission is being
      used, the voltage-angle-reference is applied to node-1

    header: b/asop02.h

entity.node-3-nul-a-elec-1

    class                                         > Node3NulA:Elec

      type A grid node to connect three grid assets, two of
      which are cables

      my sole bi-directional socket label is 'grid-1'

    builtin-remark s                              <

      socket-1 and socket-2 are my associated bi-directional
      grid assets

    node-commodity l                              > "cm-electricity-1"

      node-commodity defines the underlying commodity

    nodal-prices [$/J] F                          < 0.0 ..

      to convert to the more usual [$/MWh], multiply the
      given nodal-prices by 278

      type B grid node to connect three grid assets, only one
      of which is a cable

      my bi-directional socket labels are 'grid-1' 'grid-2'

      socket-1 is my associated bi-directional grid asset

    node-commodity l                              > "cm-electricity-1"

      node-commodity defines the underlying commodity

    nodal-prices [$/J] F                          < 0.0 ..

entity.cm-electricity-1

    class                                         > CmElectricity

      J-quantified electricity commodity

      technical assets using electricity adopt a DC-power
      flow model and thereby ignore shunt losses -- this
      commodity provides suitable support

    builtin-remark s                              <

    voltage [V] f                                 > 11.0e+03

      for fixed-frequency AC power, use the RMS (root-mean-
      square) voltage (as opposed to the peak-to-peak value)
