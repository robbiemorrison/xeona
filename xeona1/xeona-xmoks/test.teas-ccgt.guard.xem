entity.time-horizon

    class                                         > TimeHorizon

      the TimeHorizon entity is REQUIRED and the
      "time-horizon" identifier is MANDATORY

    builtin-remark s                              <

    steps [-] i                                   > 6

    leap-year [-] b                               > 0

      the start-hour begins midnight local time and ranges
      [0,23] and the start-day begins 01-Jan and ranges [1,365]

      when leap-year is true then 29 February is presumed to
      exist (although not all entities will support this)

    hemisphere s                                  > "N"

      the hemisphere is {N,S} for north and south

      the modeler should ensuring that timeseries data given
      elsewhere aligns with the specification given here

      header: b/builtins.h

entity.overseer

    class                                         > Overseer

      the Overseer entity is REQUIRED and the "overseer"
      identifier is MANDATORY

      the overseer does little more that invoke the various
      originating domains in nominated order at each new
      interval

    builtin-remark s                              <

    captrans-algorithm s                          > "simple"

      captrans-algorithm takes "fixed" | "simple" | "hop-relit"
      but only "simple" is currently implemented (this call
      contains experimental macro-controlled hop-relit code)

    ranked-orig-domains L                         > "domain-controller-1"

      the originating domain controllers must be given in
      order of DESCENDING priority, any unannounced domains
      will be discovered naturally during the various
      traversals

    total-shortrun-landuse [m2] f                 < 0.0

      the cost-type totals cover the entire horizon, with
      first step truncation given by program.last-run.run-kind

entity.domain-controller-1

    class                                         > DomainController

      a domain controller entity (the only one provided)
      which can take one of a number of commitment modes --
      but REQUIRES that the managed entities support the
      elected mode

    builtin-remark s                              <

    domain-role s                                 > "role"

    trip-coeff-span-level i                       > 1

      these four GLPK solver behavior settings should
      normally be set to true unless run-time tests indicate
      otherwise -- also coeffs means structural coefficients

    commitment-mode s                             > "fin"

      supported commitment-mode values (lmp is nodal pricing):
      fin | ghg | nox | dep | luc | lmp | merit | first

    ranked-selgates L                             > ""

      the ranked-selgates (bridging the right side) must be
      null, one, or listed in DESCENDING priority

    asset-operators L                             > ""

      the asset-operators may be null, individual, or listed
      in no particular order

    demand-junctions L                            > ""

      the demand-junctions, which split and join demand, may
      be null, individual, or listed in no particular order

    variable-costs-financial [$] F                < 0.0 ..
    fixed-costs-financial [$] F                   < 0.0 ..

      the following are consolidations for the entire domain

    subtotal-financial [$] f                      < 0.0
    subtotal-greenhouse [kg] f                    < 0.0

entity.teas-ccgt-1

    class                                         > TeasCcgt

      an industrial-scale CCGT installation featuring
      low-duty cutout and the influence of ambient air
      temperature on efficiency and capacity

      the modeler is responsible for ensuring that the
      parametrizations used here match the fuel type and
      whether the fuel is characterized by LHV or HHV

      the values provided cover the Alstom GT26 CCGT
      plant installed in Taranaki, New Zealand in 1998
      and presume HHV

      my socket is called elec-1

    builtin-remark s                              <

    cable-oxidize-commodity l                     > "cm-oxid-0"

      the socket-oxidize and cable-oxidize-commodity define
      my supplier and their socket label and our common
      oxidizable fuel commodity

    socket-electricity-commodity l                > "cm-elec-0"

      the socket-electricity-commodity defines the common
      electricity commodity

    fuel-ancillary [W] f                          > 36e+03

      the on-design-capacity and on-design-efficiency
      are at 15C and 100kPa and based on net production,
      the cutout-capacity-factor is relative to the
      on-design-capacity, the cutout-efficiency-factor
      is relative to the on-design-efficiency, and the
      fuel-ancillary defines the shutdown fuel usage

    ambient-air-context l                         > "cx-ambient-air-ts-1"

      the ambient-air-context provides temperature data,
      no adjustment is made for pressure or humidity

    shutdown-statuss [-] B                        < 0 ..

      productions represent the actual output figures,
      capacitys are the temperature-adjusted potentials, and
      shutdown-statuss are true (1) if the plant ran

    nameplate-capacity [W] f                      > 80.0

    current-age [y] i                             > 2

      a negative capex-terminal indicates salvage revenue as
      opposed to decommissioning cost

    embedded-costs-financial [$] F                < 0.0 ..

      the embedded-costs-financial are calculated using the
      DCF annuity method over the economic life of the entity
      in question
